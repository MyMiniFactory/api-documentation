# MyMiniFactory - Upload API

### Description

MyMiniFactory's Upload API provides HTTP endpoints to post a new object on MyMiniFactory with its metadata and upload the files (usually 3D files) associated to it.
This document goes through the steps of the upload process.

We stringly recommend using the API V2 with the full domain: `https://www.myminifactory.com/api/v2` followed by the API route.

### Authentication

In order to create an object and upload files on MyMiniFactory, a user should be authenticated. Please refer to the Authentication Service documentation. Once authenticated using Oauth2, all requests to the upload API endpoints should contain the Authorization header with the access token.

### Basic mechanism

The upload process consist of mostly two steps, the third step lets you check the status of the object at all time but is a good way to make sure that all the files have been successfully uploaded at the end of the process.

1. Send the information of the object you want to create with the list of files that will be attached
2. POST all the files with their upload_id to the file endpoint
3. (Optional) Check the status of the newly uploaded object to make sure all the files are successfully uploaded

### Supported file formats
We support a wide range of 3D file formats for the upload but currently only stl files are verified and available on to download on MyMiniFac. Pdf files can also be uploaded as instruction or documentation for the object.

List of supported formats for file upload:
`3dc, 3ds, ac, asc, blend, bvh, dae, dw, dwf, dxf, fbx, fbx, flt, gcode, geo, gra, iv, ive, kmz, lwo, lwz, mu, obj, osg, osgb, osgt, pdf, ply, scad, shp, stl, vpk, wrl, wrz, x, x3g`

The maximum per-file upload size is `100 MB`.
